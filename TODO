  Screenlets v0.0.11 - (c) 2007 by RYX (aka Rico Pfaus) <ryx@ryxperience.com>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the unsorted TODO-list for the Screenlets. See the file TODO-0.1.0 for a
brief roadmap and a general overview of the existing tasks and plans. The
tasks in this file are the ones to be completed before I will push the whole
project to its first official version (0.2). Before that I want all common
problems to be eliminated and have successful testing-resonance for at least the 
major (desktop-oriented) distros (ubuntu, redhat, suse, mandriva, gentoo, ...).


+ TODO: core
------------------------------------------------------------
- commandline-option for using gconf-backend
- DirectoryOption is set twice or more when selected in editor (bug in gtk?)
- use startup-notification during startup of a screenlet (to show busy cursor)
- switching themes slowly increases the memory usage (maybe rsvg leak?)
- option-definitions shouldn't be retrieved by each instance of the same
  Screenlet, there should be some global place within the session where that
  info is stored ... preferably read from the metadata-file
- the same for the Properties-dialog, it should get created once and then be
  reused by all open instances ...
- regular expression which allows hide/show individual options from the editor
  when special conditions are met (like some other option has a special value)?
- handle non-composited state by using a 2bit shape-bitmap whenever the
  "composited-changed" signal is received (so if compositing gets unavailable)
- TimeOption, DateOption (for Clock)
- XMLOption for a better and separate storage?
- ?remove __*__-attributes from Screenlet-class and find a better way for that
  (that naming is reserved for internal python-functions I think)
- make "realtime"-attribute for option available in metadata
- fix "sticky problem" (right-click menu shows incorrect values)
- removing session-folder when removing last instance of a Screenlet doesn't
  work for some reason
- (try to) stop unwanted initial saves
- find a way to get notified about end of a begin_move_drag-operation?
- ScreenletService: send signals when instance got hidden/shown?
- ??screenlets should get their own .service-files for dbus to launch the 
  main instance if none is running (causes very long delay on startup - why?)
- add/finish missing handlers:
  on_key_up, on_minimize, on_maxmize, ...
- [PermanentItem] code cleanup and bug-hunt


+ TODO: individual screenlets
		[NOTE: there may be more tasks in the individual Screenlet-files ...]
------------------------------------------------------------
- add missing states to Flower (state 7/8, dry 1, wet 1/2)
- improve Flower's "AI" (it is more "artificial insanity" than intelligence :D)
- add custom services to more screenlets (e.g. Notes, MailCheck, ...)
- icons for Windowlist, Storage, ...
- autosize on drop in Picframe
- improve Windowlist and add some options to it (and improve some things)
- ??improve Picframe to render with gtk.pixbuf instead of cairo's PNGSurface
- ??drag&drop in Control (would require editing the menu.xml)
- improve XML-based menu and use it where possible
- Pager needs some care, too
- Finish In-Place-Editing for the Notes (still some bugs in key-handling and 
  cursor-placement)
- finish all current Screenlets before adding new ones :D ...
- 5 picture Slideshow in PicframeScreenlet (with mousewheel-switching)


+ TODO: screenlets-manager
------------------------------------------------------------
- "Download more"-button and link to website
- details-button
- reset settings function
- start autostarted screenlets via menu-option
- quit all screenlets function
- (monitor all paths in SCREENLETS_PATH and check for newly installed
  screenlets (and show them if they are added and the manager is open))
