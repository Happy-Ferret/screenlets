Screenlets (short form of "Screen-Applets") are small owner-drawn applications 
that can be described as "the virtual representation of things lying/standing 
around on your desk": Sticknotes, clocks, rulers, ... the possibilities are 
endless. 

Screenlets is a widget framework that consists of small owner-drawn applications 
(written in Python, a very simple object-oriented programming-language) that can 
be described as 'the virtual representation of things lying/standing around on 
your desk'. Sticknotes, clocks, rulers, ... the possibilities are endless. 
Screenlet also tries to include some compatibility with other widget frameworks,
like web widgets and super karamba themes.

+ INSTALLATION:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Extract the archive into some directory. Navigate to that directory. 
As root-user run "make install" (Ubuntu users just add a leading "sudo"). 

By entering "make menu" (again as root) you can install .desktop-files for the
screenlets (not all, only the more stable ones). That allows easily adding 
your screenlets through the Applications-menu or the Alt+F2 dialog.

To generate the default (and ugly) pydoc-documentation within the docs-
directory, run "make pydoc".

To generate the doxygen-documentation run "make doxydoc" (you need to install 
doxygen first).

To generate the epydoc-documentation (in docs/epydoc) run "make epydoc" (you
need to install python-epydoc first). NOTE: this is the best one ;)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+ USAGE:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Use the Screenlet manager:
"screenlets-manager'

- You can run each Screenlet individually with (e.g):
"python -u /usr/share/screenlets/Clock/ClockScreenlet.py". 

- Use the command line utility (some distros don't include it):
"screenletsd"
